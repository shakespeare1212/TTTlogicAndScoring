# TTTlogicAndScoring
This is my sandbox for the back end of the Tic Tac Toe project.  This system has to keep track of the game state (that is what pieces have been moved where), and send copies to both players so that they can be in sync, and display the same gameboard.  It must also know who's turn it is, and reject requests for a move from anyone but the person authorized to move. And, it must check if someone has won the game, end the game, and reset the board for a new game.  It may also, send an update of the game results to player databases, so that can have a record of wins and losses and a ranking. This code will soon be converted to Motoko, for The Internet Computer
